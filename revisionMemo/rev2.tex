\subsection{Major Comments}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Would it be appropriate to incorporate time dependence in your model given the empirical setup.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{ \emph{
		Insert great response.
		}}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Talking about inference and using non-experimental data as you do for example on country diads may be confusing to those who may expect a treatment effects estimator.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{ \emph{
		Insert great response.
		}}
	\end{itemize}	
	\item it could be useful to compare your model to the current work going on in modelling network interdependence in statistics, engineering and epidemiology, That may make your model more relevant to the broader field.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{ \emph{
		Insert great response.

	\end{itemize}	
	\item I also recommend including the estimation of the basic logit model as that is still the starting point for many approaching this field.
