There is growing interest in the study of political networks. Network analysis allows scholars to focus away from  individual observations toward interrelationships among observations.   Many network approaches developed in descriptive fashion, and until recently most network studies have been descriptive. With greater interest in networks inferential work with networks has been growing.   \citet{cranmer:etal:2016} survey three, inferential approaches.  We present a new approach which includes additive and multiplicative specifications that capture dependencies in binary, ordinal, and continuous network data. In addition this approach, called AME,  allows the incorporation of temporal dependencies.  We develop this approach and compare it to those examined in the survey by Cranmer et alia (2016).  The AME approach is shown to be a) easy to implement, b) interpretable in a general linear model framework, c) devoid typical computational difficulties, d) avoid the risk of degeneracy in network sampling, e) capture 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order network dependencies, and f) substantially outperform multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures, exponential random graph models, and latent space approaches using  Euclidean distance metrics. AME offers a straightforward way to undertake nuanced, principled inferential network analysis for a wide range of social science questions.
