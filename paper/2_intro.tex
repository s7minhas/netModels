Network analysis provides a way to represent and study ``relational data'', that is data with characteristics extending beyond those of the individual, or in the parlance of International Relations (IR), characteristics beyond the monadic level. Data structures that extend beyond the monadic level are quite simply the norm when it comes to the study of events such as trade, interstate conflict, or the formation of international agreements. The dominant paradigm in  international relations for dealing with such data structures, however, is not a network approach but rather a dyadic design, in which an interaction between a pair of countries is considered independent of interactions between any other pair in the system.\footnote{To highlight the ubiquity of this approach the following represent just a sampling of the articles published from the 1980s to the present in the American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) and American Political Science Review (APSR) that assume dyadic independence: \citet{dixon:1983,mansfield:etal:2000,lemke:reed:2001a,mitchell:2002,dafoe:2011a,fuhrmann:sechser:2014,carnegie:2014}.}

The implication of this assumption is that when, for example, Vietnam and the United States decide to form a trade agreement, they make this decision independently of what they have done with other countries and what other countries in the international system have done among themselves.\footnote{There has been plenty of work done on treaty formation that would challenge this claim, e.g., see \citet{manger:etal:2012,kinne:2013}.} An even stronger assumption is that Japan declaring war against the United States is independent of the decision of the United States to go to war against Japan.\footnote{\citet{maoz:etal:2006,ward:etal:2007,minhas:etal:2016} would each note the importance of taking into account network dynamics in the study of interstate conflict.} A common refrain from those that favor the dyadic approach is that many events are only bilateral \citep{diehl:wright:2016}, thus alleviating the need for an approach that incorporates interdependencies between observations. This is clearly wrong. The network perspective asserts that even bilateral events and processes take place within a broader system. What takes place in one part of the system may be dependent upon events in another. At a minimum, we don't know whether independence of events and processes characterizes what we observe. We should at least examine this assertion.  

The potential for interdependence among observations poses a challenge to theoretical as well as statistical modeling since the assumption made by standard approaches used across the social sciences is that observations are, at least, conditionally independent \citep{snijders:2011}. The consequence of ignoring this assumption have been frequently noted within the political science literature already.\footnote{For example, see \citet{beck:etal:1998,signorino:1999,hoff:ward:2004,franzese:hayes:2007,cranmer:desmarais:2011,erikson:pinto:2014}.}  Just as relevant is the fact that a wealth of research from other disciplines suggests that carrying the independence assumption into a study with relational data is misguided and most often leads to biased inferences.\footnote{From Computer Science see: \citet{bonabeau:2002,brandes:erlebach:2005}. From Economics see: \citet{goyal:2012,jackson:2014}. From Psychology see: \citet{pattison:wasserman:1999,kenny:etal:2006}. From Statistics and Sociology see: \citet{snijders:1996,hoff:etal:2002}.} 

Despite the hesitation among some in the discipline to adopt network analytic approaches, in recent years there has been a greater level of interest in understanding these approaches. For instance, in the past year special issues focused on the application of a variety of network approaches have come out in the \textit{Journal of Peace Research} and \textit{International Studies Quarterly}. Particularly notable is a recent overview and comparison of a handful of network based inferential models by \citet{cranmer:etal:2016}.

Specifically, they focus on the exponential random graph model (ERGM), the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP), and a latent distance approach developed by \citet{hoff:etal:2002}. Their discussion around the differences among these approaches and their empirical comparison of them is valuable. At the same time, they overlook more than a decade worth of developments that latent variable model approaches have undergone.\footnote{Indeed, in so far as we can tell, very few in political science have actually employed the Euclidean approach they summarize.} The principal latent variable approach used in political science has been the general bilinear mixed-effects (GBME) model developed by \citet{hoff:2005}. Examples of political science applications of the GBME model include \citet{hoff:ward:2004,ward:etal:2007,cao:2009,cao:2010, cao:2012,breunig:etal:2012,ward:etal:2012,cao:ward:2014,metternich:etal:2015,greenhill:2015}.\footnote{The code necessary to run the GBME has been available since 2004 at the following address: \url{http://www.stat.washington.edu/people/pdhoff/Code/hoff_2005_jasa/}.} We are aware of only one political science application using the latent distance approach  \citep{kirkland:2012}. As \citet{hoff:2008} shows both empirically and mathematically, the distinction between the latent distance and latent factor models, such as the GBME model, is consequential when accounting for higher-order interdependencies, a point overlooked by Cranmer et al. (2016).

In this article, we review the additive and multiplicative effects model (AME). To highlight the benefits of this approach, we estimate this model using data from  the application presented in \citet{cranmer:etal:2016} and compare it to the other models presented in that article. By doing so we are able to show that AME provides a far superior goodness of fit to the data than alternative approaches.\footnote{The AME approach has been developed into an $\sf{R}$ package named \pkg{amen} and is available on \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/amen/index.html}{CRAN} \citep{hoff:etal:2015}. \citet{hoff:2015:arxiv} provides a vignette for this package as well.} Further, through the AME approach we can estimate many different types of cross-sectional and longitudinal relational data (e.g., binomial, gaussian, and ordinal edges) in a straightforward way. The rest of this article proceeds as follows: We briefly motivate the need for network oriented approaches; introduce the AME modeling framework; compare it to previous implementations of latent variable approaches; and then end by showing how this approach fits the application presented in \citet{cranmer:etal:2016}. 

We believe that this modeling framework can provide a flexible and easy to use scheme through which scholars can study relational data. It addresses the issue of interdependence while still allowing scholars to examine theories that may only be relevant in the monadic or dyadic level. Further, at the network level it accounts for nodal and dyadic dependence patterns, and provides a descriptive visualization of higher-order dependencies such as homophily and stochastic equivalence. 

% One approach has been to incorporate endogenous network parameters into extant modeling approaches (e.g., \citealp{fowler:2006, maoz:2009a}). Alternatively, we can employ a network based approach that accounts for and provides a way to measure interdependence. Latent space approach, exponential random graph model.
