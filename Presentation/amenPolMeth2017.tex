  \vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item - Early 1970s development of pseudolikelihood estimation: Ove Frank (1971); Julian Besag (1972) proposed using a logistic regression with network characteristics as covariates. Birth of ERGM.
  \item -  
  $P(x)= exp(\Theta^T s(x)- \psi(\theta))$, where $x$ is an adjacency matrix that is a graph, $s(\theta)$ are some set of sufficient statistics for the graph, and $\psi(\theta)$ is a normalizing constant, often set to be $\log \sum_x e^{\theta^T z{x)}}$. This is often estimated via pseudolikelihood, simply by regressing $x \sim \text{logit} (z(x))$.
  \item - Maximum Likelihood is a better approach with Robbins and Monro, or the importance sampling approach of Geyer \& Thompson. More advances with Bayesian approaches are available now with MCMC (Koskinen, Robins \& Pattison).
  \item - In the 1990s, networks became more widely recognized as important and the ERGM approach was often employed to estimate models in a variety of network domains. Needle sharing communities, HIV infections, for example.

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bullet$Probabilistic ERGM models place almost all of the probability on networks that
are either nearly empty (degenerate) with no linkages or nearly saturated with
all nodes being interconnected. 
\item $\bullet$The likelihood surface contains steep or discontinuous gradients
that render it impossible to solve numerically (or analytically).  Even (especially) for very small networks this is problematic.

  \vspace{-10mm}
  Relational data consists of 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item - a set of units or nodes
    \item - a set of measurements, $y_{ij}$, specific to pairs of nodes $(i,j)$ 
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Relational data assumptions}

GLM: $y_{ij} \sim \beta^{T} X_{ij} + e_{ij}$

Networks typically show evidence against independence of {$e_{ij} : i \neq j$}

Not accounting for dependence can lead to:

\begin{itemize}
\item - biased effects estimation
\item - uncalibrated confidence intervals
\item - poor predictive performance
\item - inaccurate description of network phenomena
\end{itemize}

We've been hearing this concern for decades now:

\begin{itemize}

\begin{align*}
{\textbf{u}_{i},\textbf{v}_{j}} \in \mathbb{R}^{k} \;\; i,j \in \{1, \ldots, n \} \\
\end{align*}

\vspace{-5mm}
The probability of a tie from $i$ to $j$ depends on their latent factors

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j}) &= \textbf{u}_{i}^{T} D \textbf{v}_{j} \\
  &= \sum_{k \in K} d_{k} u_{ik} v_{jk} \\
  &D \text{ is a  } K \times K \text{ diagonal matrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

Can account for both stochastic equivalence and homophily.

\frame{
  \frametitle{Inner Product versus Euclidean Distance}

We focus on two approaches to the latent space:  the latent distance model
(LDM) and the latent factor model (LFM). 

\begin{align}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Latent distance model} \\
  &\alpha(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{u}_{j}) = -|\textbf{u}_{i} - \textbf{u}_{j}| \\
  &\textbf{u}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{K}, \; i \in \{1, \ldots, n \} \\
\text{Latent factor model} \\
  &\alpha(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{u}_{j}) = \textbf{u}_{i}^{\top} \Lambda \textbf{u}_{j} \\
  &\textbf{u}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{K}, \; i \in \{1, \ldots, n \} \\
  &\Lambda \text{ a } K \times K \text{ diagonal matrix}
\label{eqn:latAlpha}
\end{aligned}
\end{align}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Putting it all together}
The AME approach can be restated as simple (\textit{simple}) regression
\begin{align}
\begin{aligned}
  y_{ij} &= g(\theta_{ij}) \\
  &\theta_{ij} = \bm\beta^{\top} \mathbf{X}_{ij} + e_{ij} \\
  &e_{ij} = a_{i} + b_{j}  + \epsilon_{ij} + \alpha(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j}) \text{  , where } \\
  &\qquad \alpha(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j}) = \textbf{u}_{i}^{\top} \textbf{D} \textbf{v}_{j} = \sum_{k \in K} d_{k} u_{ik} v_{jk}. \\
\label{eqn:ame}
\end{aligned}
\end{align}

The \texttt{amen} package implements this. Let's use it to hit some nails.

\begin{itemize}
  \item - Randomly divide the $n \times (n-1)$ data points into $S$ sets of roughly equal size, letting $s_{ij}$ be the set to which pair $\{ij\}$ is assigned.
  \item - For each $s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item - Obtain estimates of the model parameters conditional on $\{y_{ij} : s_{ij} \neq s\}$, the data on pairs not in set $s$.
    \item - For pairs $\{kl\}$ in set $s$, let $\hat y_{kl} = E[y_{kl} | \{y_{ij} : s_{ij} \neq s\}]$, the predicted value of $y_{kl}$ obtained using data not in set $s$.

\frame{\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item AME works for binary, count, and continuous relational data. 
\item AME allows longitudinal network data (i.e., tensors), wherein there can be different observations (nodes) in different time slices.  
\item AME is a regression based approach that has a numerically tractable likelihood function and it is not threatened by missing data. 
\item Is available on CRAN, with some of the more recent features to be delivered later this summer, but availble to interested beta testers.
