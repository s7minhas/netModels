  \frametitle{Motivation}

  \vspace{-10mm}
  Relational data consists of 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item - a set of units or nodes
    \item - a set of measurements, $y_{ij}$, specific to pairs of nodes $(i,j)$ 
  \end{itemize}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Relational data assumptions}

GLM: $y_{ij} \sim \beta^{T} X_{ij} + e_{ij}$

Networks typically show evidence against independence of {$e_{ij} : i \neq j$}

Not accounting for dependence can lead to:

\begin{itemize}
\item - biased effects estimation
\item - uncalibrated confidence intervals
\item - poor predictive performance
\item - inaccurate description of network phenomena
\end{itemize}

We've been hearing this concern for decades now:

  Values across a row, say $\{y_{ij},y_{ik},y_{il}\}$, may be more similar to each other than other values in the adjacency matrix because each of these values has a common sender $i$

\begin{itemize}
\item - $\sigma_{a}^{2}$ and $\sigma_{b}^{2}$ capture heterogeneity in the row and column means

  To account for these patterns we can build on what we have so far and find an expression for $\gamma$:
  
  \vspace{-5mm}
  \begin{align*}

  y_{ij} &\approx \beta^{T} X_{ij} + a_{i} + b_{j} + \gamma(u_{i},v_{j})

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{align*}
{\textbf{u}_{i},\textbf{v}_{j}} \in \mathbb{R}^{k} \;\; i,j \in \{1, \ldots, n \} \\
\end{align*}

\vspace{-5mm}
The probability of a tie from $i$ to $j$ depends on their latent factors

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j}) &= \textbf{u}_{i}^{T} D \textbf{v}_{j} \\
  &= \sum_{k \in K} d_{k} u_{ik} v_{jk} \\
  &D \text{ is a  } K \times K \text{ diagonal matrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

Can account for both stochastic equivalence and homophily

\begin{itemize}
  \item - Randomly divide the $n \times (n-1)$ data points into $S$ sets of roughly equal size, letting $s_{ij}$ be the set to which pair $\{ij\}$ is assigned.
  \item - For each $s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item - Obtain estimates of the model parameters conditional on $\{y_{ij} : s_{ij} \neq s\}$, the data on pairs not in set $s$.
    \item - For pairs $\{kl\}$ in set $s$, let $\hat y_{kl} = E[y_{kl} | \{y_{ij} : s_{ij} \neq s\}]$, the predicted value of $y_{kl}$ obtained using data not in set $s$.

You may assume this is your likelihood surface.  Courtesy of Chatterjee and Diaconis, who concluded that sufficient statistics are not sufficient to solve this problem.  Estimation of ERGMs contains this flaw, with pseudolikelihood, maximum likelihood, or MCMC.

\frame{
  \frametitle{What Does This Mean? }
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Probabilistic ERGM models place almost all of the probability on networks that
are either nearly empty (degenerate) with no linkages or nearly saturated with
all nodes being interconnected. 
\item The likelihood surface contains steep or discontinuous gradients
that render it impossible to solve numerically (or analytically).  Even (especially) for very small networks this is problematic.
\item Find a different way to estimate network data. (See above!).

Extant Political Science Examples Using Latent Distance Models Are Wrong.
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a problem with the MCMC estimator in \texttt{latentnet}. Don't use it until it is fixed.
\item Latent distance models are hard to correctly interpret, in prominent evaluations in the literature it is done incorrectly.  This is explained in their introduction a decade ago.
\item The advice in Cranmer et al is wrong: Latent network models are not biased and when correctly implemented out perform ERGM models.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Much current advice is wrong.}
  \textbf{Unfortunately some misleading and incorrect advice is in the current literature. Maybe it will be corrected.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Cranmer, Leifeld, McClurg, Rolfe (2017 AJPS) stated that latent space models are only preferable if there are few isolates, enough observations, and the interdependence is theoretically uninteresting. 

\item All of this is wrong. Not only do they incorrectly assume all latent models to be based on Euclidean distance but their statistical comparisons are based on a program that contains known errors. Moreover, using BIC to choose among different network models is itself questionable.

\item It is not true that ``ERGM offers the most preferable combination of model fit and number of parameters,'' despite their assertions.
